# Dalamud Plugins
Contains the repository JSON file for my Dalamud Plugins for third party plugin support in api4 (for Dalamud v6.0.0.0+).

## How to use
* Access Dalamud's settings by typing `/xlsettings` in the chat window and pressing enter.
* Click on the "Experimental" tab.
* Copy and Paste in the following URL into one of the blank inputs under the "Custom Plugin Repositories" section: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akira0245/DalamudPlugins/api4/pluginmaster.json`

From here, you can now install my plugins from within the game by typing `/xlplugins` in the chat and hitting enter.
Now, just select one of my plugins you wish to install like normal, and click "Install".
